Day 1, morning
- : MC
$ : Guard

$ Okay, it's mainly a formality since I know your deeds, but I need to fill the documents so I'll need to ask you a few questions. First, your name.
==> Enter name
$ What are your reasons for entering Enova?
- My sister has contracted the Blissful Sleep, and I came back to take care of her and help my parents with their inn.
$ Only people who could potentially help fight the Blissful Sleep are authorised to enter, what skill would you bring?
$ That one is easy, I'll just write "Took down the Demon Knight Lilith". Adventurers aren't often needed nowadays, but to do that, you must be quite resourceful.
--> I had help
	-Dom
	- I didn't do it alone, I was part of a group. And the brains of the group was Lanelle.
	$ Okay then : "Was part of the team that took down the Demon Knight Lilith". Don't worry too much, nobody is going to bother us with those details.
--> You're welcome
	+Dom
	- You're welcome for that.
	$...
	She looks up from the papers she was filling, but don't say anything.
$ As an adventurer, what was your speciality.
--> Leader
	++Dom
	- I gave directives and organised the group. I also specialized in sniping.
--> Jack of all trades
	- I was a Jack of all trades, but mainly long distance combat.
--> Filling the gaps
	--Dom
	- I did anything Lanelle and Rhaz needed me to do. And I'm not bad with a bow.
$ Any competence in magic?
- Only the basics, I've wanted to freshen up but never took the time.
$ What were you doing before coming here?
- Not much. I was an adventurer, but there weren't many jobs for people like us since the fall of the Demon Queen last year.
$ Place of residence, I guess your family's inn. Any acquaintances inside, again, your family.
- I have a few others, I lived there until 7 years ago.
$ Anyone important to you living outside the city? Just in case... you know...
- Not beside my party, but even then, we didn't see each other much after the end of the war. Lanelle went back to studying but I don't know where Rhaz might be, she went back adventuring, as she said.
$ Do you want us to warn them if you're infected?
- Maybe? I didn't think about them... Rhaz probably wouldn't help much, but Lanelle might be interested... Yes, warn them, just in case.
$ Okay, all is ready. If you're sure of yourself, I'll escort you to the entrance in the barrier. I must insist that it's a one way trip, and you won't be let out until the Blissful Sleep is identified or cured.
- ...
- I'm ready. It's been a long time.
