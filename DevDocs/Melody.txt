Melody, your childhood friend

Melody is an elf and even if she's older than any human, she's quite young by elven standard.
She works at the nursery and is very good with kids.
Melody was your babysitter when you were young and you kind of had a crush on her as she seemed so mature.
Now, you realise that she's quite childish and innocent when it concerns people. But she can be surprisingly wise when you don't expect it.
