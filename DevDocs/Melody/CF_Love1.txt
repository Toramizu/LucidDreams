-- Melody
$ Sarah
µ Kim

You were going to take a breather in the city park when you saw Melody watching over Sarah and another kid practicing magic.
She waves at you to come over.
-- Hey, _FirstName!
- Hello Mel', hi Sarah.
She doesn't answer, her eyes fixed on a glass of water.
-- She is training her ice magic. She was a bit sad that they didn't teach ice cream magic, but she's working hard anyway.
-- And this is Kim, she's a bit older and is the one training her.
µ Hello.
Unlike Sarah, Kim looks like a half-elf. They aren't very common and children are ever rarer.
- Hello Kim, I'm _FirstName, an old friend of Melody.
µ Do you know any magic, miss _FirstName?
- Only a few easy ones, I stopped practicing after school.
µ Oh, too bad.
-- Kim is quite good, she can freeze a whole bottle of water in a few seconds. 
Indeed, it's better than you could do right now.
µ But you still beat me, miss Melody.
-- Well, I'm older.
--> You beat me
	-Dom
	- You're both better than me, I couldn't keep a whole bottle frozen anyway.
	-- That's mainly because you don't practice. It's just like your bow, you have to do it frequently to get better at it.
	µ And you're human.
	-- Kim!
	µ But it's true, elves are better at magic, even half-elves like me.
	-- Still, that's not a good way of saying it.
	Kim grumbles a bit.
--> Change subject
- So, how is it going, Sarah?
She keeps both her hands above the glass, focusing her magic into it. You can see frost forming on the top.
$ It's hard.
- But you're doing a good job, continue like that.
-- Yes, you're learning quickly.
She smiles but doesn't look away from her glass.
During that time, you can see that Kim has started to pour water on her hand and freeze it as it flows.
-- What are you doing, Kim?
µ An ice sculpture.
You can see a bit of ice forming around her fingers. It expands quite fast, forming a shape made of ice.
After a minute, you can see an icy hart in her hands.
µ Done. What do you think, miss Melody?
-- Oh, it's cute.
µ I made it for you.
Ah, you can see the young half-elf seems to have a crush on Melody.
-- Thank you.
Melody seems to realise it too, but does her best to not react.
You stifle a laugh, but think better of it since you were in Kim's place at her age.
- I'm going to leave you to your training, they will soon need me back at the inn.
-- Okay, see you next time _FirstName.
µ Goodbye miss.
Sarah doesn't answer, still focused on her task.

During the way back, you are wondering about your feelings about Melody. Seeing Kim reminded you on how you felt as a child.
But now, you could try your luck. It might be a little awkward at the start, but more biracial couples are forming those days, so it shouldn't be too big of a problem.
The question is : do you really see the two of you becoming a couple?
--> Not for now
	You're not certain. You don't see her the same was as before, and you have other problems right now.
	You could always ask her out later.
--> Ask her out
	FLAG Mel_Love = 1
	That would be like realising a childhood dream. You'll have to do it the right way, though, she's still an elf.
