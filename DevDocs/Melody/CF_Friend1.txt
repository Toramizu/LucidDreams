Triggers anywhere, after freeing her from her Dreams
- Melody
-- MC


- Hey, _MC, can I talk to you for a moment?
-- Sure, I have some time. What is it?
- The last few days, I was really tired. Each night, I was dreaming of a fairy, and it was fun, but when I woke up, I only wanted to go back to bed. It was because you came back that I got up.
- But after a while, right after you came back, I was playing with her when she suddenly grew a... dick. Then she was trying to fuck me.
She blushed saying that.
--> Enjoyed it?
	-- So, did you enjoy her attention?

	- ... maybe a little bit?
	- Hey, stop that, that's not what I wanted to talk about.
--> Let her continue
- After she played whit me for a while, I saw you coming to save me. You managed to fight against the fairy's magic that was fun.
-- You're welcome?
- Yes, I felt like I was in danger, but I couldn't leave. I know about fairies, they are mischievous and have strong magic, it's hard to know what they'll do... Then you come out of nowhere to save me.
--> Strange dream
	-- That was a strange dream, but it looks like it was interesting.
	- Yeah, I never saw a fairy in real life, and seeing one with a big dick was fun. She slogged it around when she flew, I can't help but laugh thinking back.
--> Glad I could help
	-- Glad that I could help you, even if it's just like that.
	+50 Love
	- Emh... yes, I remember being really afraid back then. I was relieved when I saw you.
-- So, yeah, I wanted to say thank you, but now I feel stupid because it was only in my dreams.
--> That sound stupid.
	-- You're right, that sounds stupid.
	- Stop that, I already knew it, so I won't thank you.
--> I'll take it
	-- I'll take your thanks anyway, I like the sound of it.
	+50 Friendship
	- Well, thank you... you earned it... somehow...
--> You're welcome
	-- You're welcome.
	- Hey, I didn't say it yet...
	+50 Friendship
	- But thanks.
You spent some time talking about her dream. She seemed happy to have you back.
