Triggers in the INN, afternoon
- Melody
-- MC


You come back to the inn after doing a lot of chores in town. Your car is full of groceries and cleaned bedsheets.
As you start unloading them, you see Melody sitting in the entrance hall.
- Need some help?
--> It's okay
	-- It's alright, you don't need to bother.
	- ... okay.
	You do a few back and forth with her watching you silently. You can feel the awkwardness in the air as she is being strangely silent.
	--> Okay, you can help

		She gets up with a nod and follows your instructions on where to drop everything.
	--> Continue silently

	Once you finished, she talks to you, uncertain of herself.
	- Can we talk for a moment?
--> Sure
	+20 Friendship
	+20 Love
	-- Sure, once I come back, we'll get the fresh food and deliver it to the kitchen. I'll be right back.
	With the two of you, the job is quickly done. You don't talk much while doing it, but she seemed quite happy to help.
	-- Thanks for the help. You were waiting for me?
	- Not really, I only wanted to talk for a moment.
-- Sure, let's get out of the way.
You go to your room, and she seems quite uncomfortable.
-- So, what did you want to talk about? I'm sorry I don't really have time for another story, Violet's out today so I need to do her job.
- ...
She can't seem to look at you in the eyes, but it seems there is something on her mind.
--> Just spit it out
	+20 Loss
	-- You want to say something, just spit it out.
--> You can talk to me
	+20 Friendship
	-- If there's anything, you can talk to me, you know?
--> Let her talk
	+10 Friendship
	+10 Loss
	-- ...
- Do I bother you?
--> Of course not
	+10 Friendship
	+10 Love
	-- Of course you don't bother me, why are you asking?
--> Right now or in general?
	+50 Loss
	-- Do you mean right now, or in general?
--> Kind of...
	+50 Loss
	-- Kind of... you're quite... insistent on coming here.
- Everytime I come and see you, you take your time to talk to me, but I always feel like you have something else to do, but you're too polite to shoo me away.
- I only wanted to know : Do I really annoy you when I come here looking for you?
--> Yes
	-- I mean... yes. I have a lot to do around here, and not much time to rest, so...
	- I understand, I'll be going, sorry to be an annoyance...

	You can hear her sobbing on her way out, then you get up and go back to work.
--> No
	-- No, you don't bother me. It's only that I don't have a lot of free time with the inn. The inn is overflowing with clients stuck in town, Violet is always slacking, Evelyn is really bad with clients, I just wanted to help.
	She still can't look at you.
	--> Lets make a deal
		-- Let's make a deal : if you ever annoy me, be it because I have something else to do or you being really annoying, I'll tell you frankly. Will that be better for you?
		- You'll be frank?
		-- Of course.
		+20 Friendship
		+50 Love
		- Okay
	--> Did I ever say it?
		-- Did I ever say anything that made you feel that way before?
		- No directly, but I sometimes wonder if you don't want to hurt me by saying it or something like that.
		-- I don't, really. I'd tell you if that was the case.

	She's crying, but at least her eyes are looking in your direction, now.
	-- Feeling better?
	- Yeah, thanks.
	--> Why the question?
		-- So, what triggered all that?
		- Well, I was only coming here to spend time, but looking at you work, I realised that I always came here while you were busy or working.
		You know her enough to know it's time to joke a little to relieve the tension.
		-- Yes, but what would be the alternative? Me waiting for you? I like you, but that would be a bit creepy, no?
		+10 Friendship
		She cry-laughs at that answer.
		- I know, I'm stupid.
	--> Let her be
	- I'll find a way to solve that problem, don't worry. It's just that I don't want you to have negative emotions about me.
	You hear your mom shouting your name from the hallway.
	- Okay, I'll be going now. I've taken enough of your time for today.
	-- Come back whenever you want.
