Blissful Sleep is a game I've been working on for a few weeks.
I am currently using "borrowed" art for it, but I might ask for donations later to commission an artist to have a consistent style.

The game is based in a techno-magic universe (like Final Fantasy)
All succubi are hermaphrodites, or futas, as is the main character. Others will mainly be females with a few futas. I am quite awkward at writing mens, so I'll skip that for now, maybe later...

The game is based on Dicey Dungeons, a dice based rogue like.
You dive in the dreams of a town to battle the succubi invading them and free the people from their influence.
Each night is a Dream Dive, where you start with basic abilities and a low max Arousal, and go deeper into the dreams by fighting to the first orgasm.
If she orgasms first, you can continue, otherwise you wake up covered in your shame and have to wait until next night to retry.

You use the dice you roll each turn on abilities to trigger them, and then it's the opponent's turn.
You steal a random ability from your opponent on a win, and you can buy other in the shop, as well as more Max Arousal and more dice.

For the sexy side of the game, there will be both quick sex scenes without emotional baggage with the succubi, and relationships leading to sex with the day characters.
The scenes with succubi will happen if they win a fight, or you can choose to have a scene with them when you win (and get a few bonuses).
With the day characters, you will have to progress in their relation before they are willing to have sex. Those relations will change based on choices during their progression and some other factors.

Fetishes :
- Mandatory : Futanari, Monster Girls, Dom/Sub, Romance
- Optional : None for now

What I need help for :
- Bug hunting
- Opinions
- Idea for succubi / Art to "borrow" / Abilities

What next? :
- 1st, Meditation events : for now, when you get to a meditation spot, you simply restore all your Arousal, but there will be events added where you might need to sacrifice something to be allowed to meditate.
- Implement the story
- During the day, you'll be able to meet new people and find new playable succubi
- Implement progression, where you develop relationships with the people to empower their succubus
- Night events with impact during the day, and the other way around

Why "borrowed" art, not stolen?
I consider that I borrow it without consent rather than steal it mainly because I clearly say it's not mine and most of it have a direct link to the original, available on the purple "borrower" on the images.
